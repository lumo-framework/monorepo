# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help secure **tsc-run**!  
This monorepo contains the **CLI, adapters, and core framework runtime**.  
Because we‚Äôre still in **alpha**, some timelines and guarantees differ from a mature project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Status & Expectations

- APIs are still changing; breaking updates may land without deprecations.
- **Security issues take precedence**, but all timelines are ‚Äúbest-effort‚Äù (see below).
- We don‚Äôt recommend production deployments until we reach beta.

Patches are released as soon as they merge into `main`.
