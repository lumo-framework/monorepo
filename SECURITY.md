# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help secure **Lumo Framework**!  
This monorepo contains the **CLI, adapters, and core framework runtime**.  
Because we’re still in **alpha**, some timelines and guarantees differ from a mature project.

## ⚠️ Alpha Status & Expectations

- APIs are still changing; breaking updates may land without deprecations.
- **Security issues take precedence**, but all timelines are “best-effort” (see below).
- We don’t recommend production deployments until we reach beta.

---

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

During alpha we patch **only** the default branch:

| Branch / Tag              | Supported?                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `main` (latest alpha)     | ✅                                     |
| Any tag `< 0.2.0-alpha.7` | ❌ _(please upgrade before reporting)_ |

Patches are released as soon as they merge into `main`.
