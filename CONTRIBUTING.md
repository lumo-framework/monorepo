# Contributing to tsc.run (TypeScript Cloud)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to tsc.run! This project aims to make serverless development with TypeScript simple and intuitive through conventions and a standard project layout. We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## Project Overview

tsc.run (TypeScript Cloud) is a serverless framework that helps developers build, organise, and deploy serverless applications. The framework follows a "convention over configuration" approach - you simply define functions, export them, and tsc.run handles routing, deployment, and infrastructure automatically.

The project consists of multiple repositories:

- **Monorepo**: The tsc.run CLI, Core framework and cloud adapters.
- **tsc.run**: The example app for new tsc.run projects.
- **Documentation Site**: The docs.tsc.run website and developer guides.

2. Use our bug report template.
3. Include reproduction steps with a minimal example project.
