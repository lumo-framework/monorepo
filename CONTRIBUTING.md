# Contributing to Lumo Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lumo Framework! This project aims to make serverless development with TypeScript simple and intuitive through conventions and a standard project layout. We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## Project Overview

Lumo Framework is a serverless framework that helps developers build, organise, and deploy serverless applications. The framework follows a "convention over configuration" approach - you simply define functions, export them, and Lumo handles routing, deployment, and infrastructure automatically.

The project consists of multiple repositories:

- **Monorepo**: The Lumo Framework CLI, Core Framework, and cloud adapters.
- **lumo**: The example app for new Lumo Framework projects.
- **Documentation Site**: The Lumo Framework website and developer guides.

## Ways to Contribute

### üêõ Bug Reports

Found a bug in the framework or deployment process? Help us improve:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Use our bug report template.
3. Include reproduction steps with a minimal example project.
4. Provide environment details (Node.js version, cloud provider).
5. Include relevant logs from Lumo Framework or deployment output.

### üí° Feature Requests

Have an idea for improving the serverless development experience?

1. Check if it's already been suggested.
2. Open a discussion to get feedback from the community.
3. Describe the serverless use case you're trying to solve.

### üìù Documentation

Documentation improvements help the entire serverless community:

- Fix typos or unclear deployment instructions.
- Add examples for different serverless patterns.
- Improve getting started guides for various cloud providers.
- Create tutorials for common serverless architectures.

### üîß Code Contributions

Ready to contribute to Lumo Framework? Here's how:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (we recommend using the latest LTS version).
- npm / pnpm.
- Git for version control.
- TypeScript knowledge, any experience :)
- Basic familiarity with serverless concepts.
- Access to a cloud provider account for testing deployments.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lumo-framework/monorepo.git
   cd monorepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build all packages**:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Verify setup by running tests**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

### Multi-Repository Workflow

TODO

### Testing

We use a comprehensive testing strategy across the monorepo:

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests across packages
pnpm test

# Run tests for a specific package
cd packages/cli && pnpm test
cd packages/core && pnpm test
cd packages/adapter-aws && pnpm test
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Code formatting
pnpm format

# Check formatting without changes
pnpm format:check
```

#### Testing Your Changes

1. **Unit tests**: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Build verification**: Run `pnpm build` to ensure all packages compile
3. **Integration testing**: Test CLI commands with a sample project

### Local Development

#### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build specific package during development
cd packages/cli && pnpm build
cd packages/core && pnpm build
cd packages/adapter-aws && pnpm build
```

### Commit Messages

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for clear project history:

## Submitting Changes
